Glossary
NOTE
The definitions in this glossary are short and simple, intended to convey the core idea but not
the full subtleties of a term. For more detail, follow the references to the main text.
asynchronous
Not waiting for something to complete (e.g., sending data over the network
to another node), and not making any assumptions about how long it is going
to take. See “Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Replication”, “Synchronous
Versus Asynchronous Networks”, and “System Model and Reality”.
atomic
1. In the context of concurrency, describes an operation that appears to take
effect at a single point in time, so another concurrent process can never
encounter the operation in a “half-finished” state. See also isolation.
2. In the context of transactions, describes grouping together a set of writes
that must either all be committed or all be rolled back, even if faults
occur. See “Atomicity” and “Two-Phase Commit”.
backpressure
Forcing the sender of data to slow down when the recipient cannot keep up
with it. Also known as flow control. See “When an Overloaded System
Won’t Recover”.
batch process
A computation that takes a fixed (and usually large) set of data as input and
produces other data as output, without modifying the input. See Chapter 11.

bounded
Having a known upper limit or size. Used, for example, in the context of
network delay (see “Timeouts and Unbounded Delays”) and datasets (see the
introduction to Chapter 12).
Byzantine fault
A fault that is characterized by a node behaving incorrectly in an arbitrary
way (e.g., by sending contradictory or malicious messages to other nodes).
See “Byzantine Faults”.
cache
A component that remembers recently used data in order to speed up future
reads of the same data. It is generally not complete; any data that is missing
from the cache has to be fetched from an underlying, slower data storage
system that has a complete copy of the data.
CAP theorem
A widely misunderstood theoretical result that is not useful in practice. See
“The CAP theorem”.
causality
The dependency between events that arises when one thing “happens before”
another thing in a system—for example, a later event that occurs in response
to, builds upon, or should be understood in the light of an earlier event. See
“The happens-before relation and concurrency”.
consensus
A fundamental problem in distributed computing concerning getting several
nodes to agree on something (e.g., which node should be the leader for a
database cluster). The problem is much harder than it seems at first glance.
See “Consensus”.
data warehouse
A database in which data from several OLTP systems has been combined and

prepared to be used for analytics purposes. See “Data Warehousing”.
declarative
Describes the properties that something should have, but not the exact steps
for how to achieve it. In the context of database queries, a query optimizer
takes a declarative query and decides how it should best be executed. See
“Terminology: Declarative Query Languages”.
denormalize
To introduce some amount of redundancy or duplication in a normalized
dataset, typically in the form of a cache or index, in order to speed up reads.
A denormalized value is a kind of precomputed query result, similar to a
materialized view. See “Normalization, Denormalization, and Joins”.
derived data
A dataset created from other data through a repeatable process, which you
could run again if necessary. Usually, derived data is needed to speed up a
particular kind of read access to the data. Indexes, caches, and materialized
views are examples of derived data. See “Systems of Record and Derived
Data”.
deterministic
Describes a function that always produces the same output if you give it the
same input. This means it cannot depend on random numbers, the time of
day, network communication, or other unpredictable things. See “The Power
of Determinism”.
distributed
Running on several nodes connected by a network. Characterized by partial
failures: a part of the system may be broken while other parts are still
working, and it is often impossible for the software to know what exactly is
broken. See “Faults and Partial Failures”.
durable

Storing data in such a way that you believe it will not be lost, even if various
faults occur. See “Durability”.
ETL
Extract–transform–load. The process of extracting data from a source
database, transforming it into a form that is more suitable for analytical
queries, and loading it into a data warehouse or batch processing system. See
“Data Warehousing”.
failover
In systems that have a single leader, failover is the process of moving the
leadership role from one node to another. See “Handling Node Outages”.
fault-tolerant
Able to recover automatically if something goes wrong (e.g., if a machine
crashes or a network link fails). See “Reliability and Fault Tolerance”.
flow control
See backpressure.
follower
A replica that does not directly accept any writes from clients, but only
processes data changes that it receives from a leader. Also known as a
secondary, read replica, or hot standby. See “Single-Leader Replication”.
full-text search
Searching text by arbitrary keywords, often with additional features such as
matching similarly spelled words or synonyms. A full-text index is a kind of
secondary index that supports such queries. See “Full-Text Search”.
graph
A data structure consisting of vertices (things that you can refer to, also
known as nodes or entities) and edges (connections from one vertex to
another, also known as relationships or arcs). See “Graph-Like Data

Models”.
hash
A function that turns an input into a random-looking number. The same input
always returns the same number as output. Two different inputs will likely
have two different numbers as output, although two different inputs could
produce the same output (this is called a collision). See “Sharding by Hash of
Key”.
idempotent
Describes an operation that can be safely retried; if it is executed more than
once, it has the same effect as if it were executed only once. See
“Idempotence”.
index
A data structure that lets you efficiently search for all records that have a
particular value in a particular field. See “Storage and Indexing for OLTP”.
isolation
In the context of transactions, describes the degree to which concurrently
executing transactions can interfere with each other. Serializable isolation
provides the strongest guarantees, but weaker isolation levels are also used.
See “Isolation”.
join
To bring together records that have something in common. Most commonly
used when one record has a reference to another (a foreign key, a document
reference, an edge in a graph) and a query needs to get the record that the
reference points to. See “Normalization, Denormalization, and Joins” and
“Joins and Grouping”.
leader
When data or a service is replicated across several nodes, the leader is the
designated replica that is allowed to make changes. A leader may be elected

through a protocol or manually chosen by an administrator. Also known as
the primary or source. See “Single-Leader Replication”.
linearizable
Behaving as if only a single copy of data is in the system, which is updated
by atomic operations. See “Linearizability”.
locality
A performance optimization: putting several pieces of data in the same place
if they are frequently needed at the same time. See “Data locality for reads
and writes”.
lock
A mechanism to ensure that only one thread, node, or transaction can access
something, and anyone else who wants to access the same thing must wait
until the lock is released. See “Two-Phase Locking” and “Distributed Locks
and Leases”.
log
An append-only file for storing data. A write-ahead log is used to make a
storage engine resilient against crashes (see “Making B-trees reliable”), a
log-structured storage engine uses logs as its primary storage format (see
“Log-Structured Storage”), a replication log is used to copy writes from a
leader to followers (see “Single-Leader Replication”), and an event log can
represent a data stream (see “Log-Based Message Brokers”).
materialize
To perform a computation eagerly and write out its result, as opposed to
calculating it on demand when requested. See “Event Sourcing and CQRS”.
node
An instance of software running on a computer, which communicates with
other nodes via a network in order to accomplish a task.
normalized

Structured in such a way that there is no redundancy or duplication. In a
normalized database, when a piece of data changes, you need to change it in
only one place, not many copies in many places. See “Normalization,
Denormalization, and Joins”.
OLAP
Online analytical processing. An access pattern characterized by aggregating
(e.g., count, sum, average) over a large number of records. See “Operational
Versus Analytical Systems”.
OLTP
Online transaction processing. An access pattern characterized by fast
queries that read or write a small number of records, usually indexed by key.
See “Operational Versus Analytical Systems”.
percentile
A way of measuring the distribution of values by counting how many values
are above or below a certain threshold. For example, the 95th percentile
response time during some period is the time t such that 95% of requests in
that period complete in less than t, and 5% take longer than t. See
“Describing Performance”.
primary key
A value (typically a number or a string) that uniquely identifies a record. In
many applications, primary keys are generated by the system when a record
is created (e.g., sequentially or randomly); they are not usually set by users.
See also secondary index.
quorum
The minimum number of nodes that need to vote on an operation before it
can be considered successful. See “Using quorums for reading and writing”.
rebalance
To move data or services from one node to another in order to spread the

load fairly. See “Sharding of Key-Value Data”.
replication
Keeping a copy of the same data on several nodes (replicas) so that it
remains accessible if a node becomes unreachable. See Chapter 6.
schema
A description of the structure of data, including its fields and datatypes.
Whether data conforms to a schema can be checked at various points in the
data’s lifetime (see “Schema flexibility in the document model”), and a
schema can change over time (see Chapter 5).
secondary index
An additional data structure that is maintained alongside the primary data
storage and that allows you to efficiently search for records that match a
certain kind of condition. See “Multicolumn and Secondary Indexes” and
“Sharding and Secondary Indexes”.
serializable
An isolation guarantee that if several transactions execute concurrently, they
behave the same as if they had executed one at a time, in a serial order. See
“Serializability”.
sharding
Splitting a large dataset or computation that is too big for a single machine
into smaller parts and spreading them across several machines. Also known
as partitioning. See Chapter 7.
shared-nothing
An architecture in which independent nodes—each with its own CPUs,
memory, and disks—are connected via a conventional network, in contrast to
shared-memory or shared-disk architectures. See “Shared-Memory, Shared-
Disk, and Shared-Nothing Architectures”.
skew

1. Imbalanced load across shards, such that some shards have lots of
requests or data and others have much less. Also known as hot spots. See
“Skewed Workloads and Relieving Hot Spots”.
2. A timing anomaly that causes events to appear in an unexpected,
nonsequential order. See the discussions of read skew in “Snapshot
Isolation and Repeatable Read”, write skew in “Write Skew and
Phantoms”, and clock skew in “Timestamps for ordering events”.
split brain
A scenario in which two nodes simultaneously believe themselves to be the
leader, which may cause system guarantees to be violated. See “Handling
Node Outages” and “The Majority Rules”.
stored procedure
A way of encoding the logic of a transaction such that it can be entirely
executed on a database server, without communicating back and forth with a
client during the transaction. See “Actual Serial Execution”.
stream process
A continually running computation that consumes a never-ending stream of
events as input and derives output from it. See Chapter 12.
synchronous
The opposite of asynchronous.
system of record
A system that holds the primary, authoritative version of data, also known as
the source of truth. Changes are first written here, and other datasets may be
derived from the system of record. See “Systems of Record and Derived
Data”.
timeout

One of the simplest ways of detecting a fault—namely, by observing the lack
of a response within a certain amount of time. However, it is impossible to
know whether a timeout is due to a problem with the remote node or an issue
in the network. See “Timeouts and Unbounded Delays”.
total order
A way of comparing two things (e.g., timestamps) that allows you to always
say which one is greater and which one is lesser. An ordering in which some
things are incomparable (you cannot say which is greater or smaller) is called
a partial order.
transaction
Grouping together several reads and writes into a logical unit in order to
simplify error handling and concurrency issues. See Chapter 8.
two-phase commit (2PC)
An algorithm to ensure that several database nodes either all atomically
commit or all abort a transaction. See “Two-Phase Commit”.
two-phase locking (2PL)
An algorithm for achieving serializable isolation that works by a transaction
acquiring a lock on all data it reads or writes and holding the lock until the
end of the transaction. See “Two-Phase Locking”.
unbounded
Not having any known upper limit or size. The opposite of bounded.
