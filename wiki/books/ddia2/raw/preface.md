Preface
There are hundreds of databases to choose from. Which one should you use for
your application? The short answer is, “It depends.” The long answer is…this
book.
Different technologies for storing and processing data make different trade-offs,
and no one approach is best for all situations. The system that is a perfect fit for
one application is badly suited to another. This book is a guide to the entire
landscape of data systems, not just looking at one product, but comparing the
strengths and weaknesses of many systems.
Although the landscape of technologies for processing and storing data is diverse
and fast-changing, the underlying principles endure. If you understand those
principles, you’re in a position to see where each tool fits in, how to make good
use of it, and how to avoid its pitfalls. This book focuses on those principles.
While this book is not a tutorial for using one particular tool, it isn’t a textbook
full of dry theory either. Instead, we will look at many examples of successful
data systems: technologies that form the foundation of numerous popular
applications and that have to meet scalability, performance, and reliability
requirements in production every day. We will dig into the internals of those
systems, tease apart their key algorithms, and discuss the trade-offs they have
made. On this journey, we will try to find useful ways of thinking about data
systems—not just how they work, but also why they work that way.
After reading this book, you will be in a great position to determine which kinds
of technologies are appropriate for which purposes and to understand how tools
can be combined to form the foundation of a solid application architecture. You
will develop a strong intuition for what your systems are doing under the hood
so that you can reason about their behavior, make good design decisions, and
track down any problems that may arise.
The guiding philosophy of this book is to bring together a broad range of
perspectives: both theoretical and practical, both recent and old. The computing
industry tends to be attracted to things that are new and shiny and to look down

on ideas that are considered old or academic. That is a mistake; many powerful,
foundational ideas in computing arose from research, some recent, some decades
ago. On the other hand, academia sometimes lacks a clear idea of what issues are
important in practice. This book combines the best of both: academic precision
and attention to detail with an industrial focus on practicality.
Who Should Read This Book?
If any of the following are true for you, you’ll find this book valuable:
You’re a software engineer, software architect, or technical manager
who needs to make decisions about the architecture of the systems you
work on—for example, you need to choose tools for solving a given
problem and figure out how best to apply them. This applies especially
to backend systems.
You’re a data engineer who wants to understand the wider context of the
systems you deal with, or a cloud engineer who wants insights into the
underpinnings of the systems you’re using. You will find that even
though modern distributed systems hide a lot of complexity from you,
understanding their underlying principles is extremely useful for
performance optimization and debugging.
You want to learn how to make data systems scalable (e.g., to support
apps with millions of users), highly available (minimizing downtime),
operationally robust, and easier to maintain in the long run (even as they
grow and as requirements and technologies change).
You are preparing for a “system design” job interview in which you will
be asked to sketch an architecture for an application, and you need to
learn the principles for good data architectures.
You are curious to find out what goes on behind the scenes at major
websites and online services, and inside various databases and data
processing systems—especially if you like to dig deeper than
buzzwords to gain a technically accurate and precise understanding of
various technologies and their trade-offs.

This book assumes that you already have some experience building web-based
applications and that you are familiar with relational databases and SQL. A high-
level understanding of common network protocols like TCP and HTTP is
helpful. Your choice of programming language or framework makes no
difference for this book.
What’s New in the Second Edition?
This second edition has the same goals and scope as the first edition of
Designing Data-Intensive Applications, which was published in 2017. However,
we have thoroughly revised the entire book to reflect technological changes that
have happened in the last decade and to improve the clarity of the explanations.
The biggest technical changes that have affected this book since the first edition
are the explosion of interest in AI and the rise of cloud native data systems
architectures. While this book is not about AI per se, we have added coverage of
data systems that support AI and machine learning, including vector indexes
(used for semantic search), DataFrames (used for training datasets), and batch
processing systems for preparing large amounts of training data. Cloud native
ideas, such as building data systems on top of object stores instead of local disks,
have been woven in throughout the book.
We have also added discussions of sync engines and local-first software,
workflow engines and durable execution, formal methods and randomized
testing, GraphQL, and various other technologies that are worth knowing about.
We have included a bit of legal context as well, by exploring the impact of the
EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and related law. We’ve also
taken a few things away—for example, as MapReduce is now largely obsolete,
we have rewritten the batch processing chapter accordingly, and we sadly
decided to drop the Tolkien-style maps.
A few discussions have been restructured, and the chapter numbering has
changed. Some chapters required only a light edit, while others (such as
Chapter 10, on consistency and consensus) were almost completely rewritten to
make them clearer. Overall, the second edition is about 60 pages longer than the
first.

References and Further Reading
Most of what we discuss in this book has already been said elsewhere in some
form or another—in conference presentations, research papers, blog posts, code,
bug trackers, mailing lists, or engineering folklore. This book summarizes the
most important ideas from many sources, and it includes pointers to the original
literature throughout the text. The references at the end of each chapter are great
resources if you want to explore an area in more depth, and most of them are
freely available online.
In the ebook editions we have included links to the full text of online resources.
As links tend to break frequently because of the nature of the web, we have also
included archival links where possible. If you come across a broken link, or if
you are reading a print copy of this book, you can use a search engine to look up
references. For academic papers, search for the title in Google Scholar to find
open-access (free) PDF files. Books might cost money, but you shouldn’t have to
pay for research papers.
Alternatively, you can find all the references at https://github.com/ept/ddia2-
references, where we maintain up-to-date links.
